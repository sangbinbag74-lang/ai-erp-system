# AI ERP - LLM-Powered ERP System

AI-driven Enterprise Resource Planning system built on ERPNext foundation with advanced LLM integration.

## Overview

This project transforms the traditional ERP experience by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) as the core engine for business operations. Unlike conventional ERPNext deployments, our system enables users to interact naturally through conversational interfaces while the AI autonomously handles complex file operations, data analysis, and business process automation.
